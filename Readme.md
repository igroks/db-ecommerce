# db-amazon_meta

This project is a practical evaluation of the Database I discipline of the Computer Science course at the Federal University of Amazonas.

The purpose of the project is to learn how to build a relational database, in this case using DBMS PostgreSQL, from an Amazon 'amazon-meta' database.

The work consisted of reading and extracting the data, the abstraction of a good model for the database schema, and finally, after the creation of the database, the assembly of queries proposed as evaluative challenges.
